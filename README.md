# AppVault (React Router Project)


## 📖 Overview

AppVault is a React-based single-page application (SPA) that uses **React Router** for client-side routing. The app lets users navigate between multiple “pages” without full page reloads. This makes the user experience seamless and more like a native app. AppVault can be used as a boilerplate or as a foundation for larger React projects that need multi-page navigation.
